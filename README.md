# StockMarket


This app is my submission for Hacathon 5.0 organised by Flipr.ai.
This app shows the stock market index of various companies such as 
Tata Steels, Ashoke Leyland, Reliance etc. on a graph. Also it also
indicates the opening price , closing price, high price, low price 
of shares/stocks of the campanies.


The minimum Skd requirement of this application is API 19 & targeted 
API is 29.

The login and registration services are managed by Firebase cloud services.
A local Sqlite Database is also setuped to store the stock market indexes
and campany data.

App also implements MPAndroidChart library to generate line graph of 
stock price fluctuation.


The app do not require any special steps other than standard procedure.
