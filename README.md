# StockMarket

## Overview
This app was my submission for Hacathon 5.0 organised by Flipr.ai. 
and it was given A grade by the judges of the event.

This app shows the stock market index of various companies such as 
Tata Steels, Ashoke Leyland, Reliance etc. on a graph. Also it also
indicates the opening price , closing price, high price, low price 
of shares/stocks of the campanies.
The login and registration services are managed by Firebase cloud services.
A local Sqlite Database is also setuped to store the stock market indexes
and campany data.

App also implements MPAndroidChart library to generate line graph of 
stock price fluctuation.
